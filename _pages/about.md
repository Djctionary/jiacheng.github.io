<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi, I am a fourth-year undergraduate student working at the Robotics Institute under [Prof. Sarath Kodagoda](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Sarath.Kodagoda) at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). I spent my first two college years at Northeastern University (NEU), where I joined the [HACI Lab](https://cz26.github.io/CZ-HP/lab/) and was advised by [Dr. Changzeng Fu](https://cz26.github.io/CZ-HP/lab/).

My research interests focus on deploying AI algorithms, especially Reinforcement Learning (RL), to control robots (quadruped/humanoid) and autonomous systems. I am still expanding my horizons and exploring new areas in this field.

In my spare time, I'm passionate about developing AI applications for health and wellness. I collaborate with [Ziyi Zhao](https://ziyizhao-bio.github.io/) (Ph.D. student at UTS) on web-based AI health platforms, including [Palm Stream](https://palmstream.net) and [Skinova](https://skinova.au), which leverage AI technology to help people live healthier lives through smart skincare analysis and personalized health solutions.

I am currently looking for Ph.D. positions starting Fall 2026. You can check my CV here: [📄 CV](#)
